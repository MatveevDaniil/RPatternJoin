Description: This project is a tool for words edit similarity joins (a.k.a. all-pairs similarity search) under small (< 3) edit distance constraints. It works for Levenshtein distance (deletions, insertions, substitutions) and Hamming distance (substitutions, insertions/deletions from the end). The software is specifically optimized for edit similarity joins of amino-acid sequences from TCR/BCR profiles, where the number of words is relatively large (10^5-10^6) and the average length of words is relatively small (~20).
